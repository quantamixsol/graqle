# AI writes code. Gra**Q**le makes it safe.

> **We ran Graqle on a 6-file "vibe coded" app. 90 seconds. 8 bugs. 4 of them invisible to pylint, mypy, flake8, and Copilot combined. One was a HIPAA violation. All fixed. Cost: $0.001.**

**The mandatory infrastructure layer between your AI code generators and production.**
Scan any codebase into a persistent knowledge graph. Every module becomes a reasoning agent.
Every change is impact-analysed, gate-checked, and taught back — automatically.

> *"Bugs don't live in files. They live between files. Every other tool sees one file at a time. Graqle sees the relationships."*

## The problem with AI coding at scale

Copilot writes auth logic. Cursor generates your API layer. Claude Code refactors your service layer. All of it ships fast. None of it is checked at the architectural level.

**Bugs don't live in files. They live between files.**

In a 6-file dental appointment system we built as a demo, every single tool — pylint, mypy, flake8, Copilot — missed 4 of the 8 bugs. Because those bugs only exist in the relationship between files:

- `app.py` assumed `services.py` checks auth on the cancel endpoint
- `services.py` assumed `app.py` already checked it
- Neither did
- Any unauthenticated HTTP client could cancel any patient's appointment

That is a HIPAA violation. That is what vibe coding at scale produces. That is what Graqle catches.

---

## The 90-second proof

```bash
# 1. Scan any codebase into a knowledge graph
graq scan repo .
# → 5,579 nodes, 19,916 edges — full architecture mapped in seconds

# 2. Ask Graqle to audit it
graq run "find every security vulnerability in this codebase"
# → Graph-of-agents activates across 50 nodes
# → Traces cross-file attack chain: MD5 (models.py) → expired tokens
#    never checked (auth.py) → cancel endpoint with zero auth (app.py)
# → Confidence: 89% | Evidence: 3-file chain | Cost: ~$0.001

# 3. Fix it — Graqle shows exact before/after for each file
# 4. Teach it back — the graph never forgets
graq learn "cancel endpoint must always require auth token"
# → Lesson persists. Every future audit knows this rule.
# → Copilot forgot. Graqle remembered.
```

**Dental audit results (live, AWS Bedrock, 2026-03-28):**

| Metric | Result |
|:-------|:-------|
| Files scanned | 6 (410 lines) |
| Bugs found | **8 (2 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM)** |
| Cross-file bugs (invisible to linters) | **4** |
| Reasoning confidence | **89–90%** |
| Fixes applied | **8/8** |
| Verification checks | **12/12 PASSED** |
| Total cost | **~$0.001** |

## What makes Graqle structurally different

Every other AI tool works at the **file level**. Graqle works at the **relationship level**.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### The graph IS the reasoning architecture

Every node is simultaneously a knowledge entity AND a reasoning agent. The graph topology determines *who* reasons. Edge weights encode *what was learned*. Ontological constraints govern *what reasoning is permitted*. Results mutate the same graph that governs future reasoning.

**This is a closed developmental loop.** No stateless tool can replicate it without rebuilding the entire persistent typed graph layer from scratch.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Cross-file bugs. Found automatically.

```
app.py ──imports──> services.py
    |                    |
    └──assumes auth──────┘
         checked here

Neither checks. Graqle sees both.
Copilot sees one file at a time.
```

The assumption gap between `app.py` and `services.py` is invisible to any single-file tool. Graqle maps the relationship, activates both as agents, and surfaces the contradiction at 89% confidence.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

### Persistent architectural memory

```bash
graq learn "auth must be in services layer"
# Written to graph as weighted LESSON edge
# Survives git ops, session resets, team changes
# Every future audit activates this lesson
```

Lessons compound. The longer your team uses Graqle, the more it knows about your specific architecture, your specific past mistakes, your specific safety rules. That compounding is the moat.

</td>
<td>

### Governance gates before code is written

```bash
graq preflight "refactor the auth layer"
# → 12 modules depend on auth
# → 3 have no tests
# → 2 past lessons activated
# → LESSON: cancel endpoint must require auth
# → Risk: HIGH — proceed with plan
```

The gate runs before a single line changes. Not a linter rule. The graph reasoning about the specific change in the context of your specific architecture.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

                            Graph evolves with every      graq preflight / graq impact
                            interaction and lesson        Gate every change before it ships
```

**6-gate validation pipeline** — every scanned node passes: parse integrity → completeness repair → chunk quality → edge deduplication → relationship inference → compilation verification. Hollow nodes are auto-repaired, never silently dropped. Health threshold: 95% chunk coverage + 99% edge integrity = HEALTHY.

---

## Model agnostic. Works everywhere.

Graqle is not tied to any AI provider. The knowledge graph and reasoning architecture are completely decoupled from the backend. One line in `graqle.yaml` switches providers.

| Backend | Best For | Cost |
|:--------|:---------|:-----|
| **Ollama** | Fully offline, air-gapped, zero cost | $0 |
| **AWS Bedrock** | Enterprise IAM, your own account | AWS pricing |
| **Anthropic** | Deepest reasoning, Claude Opus | ~$0.001/q |
| **OpenAI** | Broad compatibility | ~$0.001/q |
| **Groq** | Sub-second responses | ~$0.0005/q |
| **DeepSeek / Mistral / Gemini / Together / Fireworks / Cohere / OpenRouter / vLLM / Custom** | Various | Various |

```yaml
# graqle.yaml — smart task routing
model:
  backend: bedrock
  model: eu.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6
  region: eu-north-1

routing:
  rules:
    - task: reason
      provider: bedrock
      model: eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1
      profile: your-aws-profile    # uses your existing AWS credentials
    - task: context
      provider: groq               # fast lookups on cheap model
```

**Works with every AI IDE:** Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code + Copilot, Windsurf, JetBrains — zero workflow change. Graqle adds 74 architecture-aware MCP tools your AI uses automatically.

## What Graqle does that competitors cannot

| | Copilot / Cursor | LangChain / CrewAI | LlamaIndex | **Graqle** |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Sees cross-file relationships** | No | No | No | **Yes — typed graph** |
| **Finds cross-file bugs** | No | No | No | **Yes — 4/8 dental bugs** |
| **Persistent architectural memory** | No — resets | No — stateless | No — stateless | **Yes — compounds** |
| **Blast radius before change** | No | No | No | **Yes — BFS traversal** |
| **Governance gate** | No | Prompt rules | No | **Yes — graph-enforced** |
| **Learns from every audit** | No | No | No | **Yes — edge weights** |
| **Works offline / air-gapped** | No | No | No | **Yes — Ollama** |
| **Self-improves over time** | No | No | No | **Yes — closed loop** |

**The structural reason competitors cannot copy this:** They are stateless. Graqle's moat is a persistent typed knowledge graph where topology governs agent activation, ontological constraints bound reasoning, edge weights encode institutional memory, and results mutate the same structure that governs future cognition. You cannot replicate this with prompt engineering. You have to rebuild the entire layer.

## Use cases

<details>
<summary><b>Auditing an existing production application</b></summary>

Point Graqle at any codebase. It scans in minutes. You get:
- Full blast radius for every file — what breaks if this changes
- Cross-file vulnerability chains traced across auth, business logic, data layers
- Architectural coupling violations and assumption gaps between modules
- Security issues: auth bypass, injection vectors, insecure crypto, data exposure
- All findings with confidence scores and file-level evidence

No prior knowledge of the codebase required. The graph maps it for you.

```bash
graq scan repo .
graq run "find every security vulnerability"
graq run "what are the highest-risk files to change?"
graq impact auth.py    # blast radius: what breaks if auth changes
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Building a new application with AI</b></summary>

Every function you add gets mapped to the graph immediately. Before writing the next function, run preflight: the graph tells you what this will affect, whether something similar already exists, whether this introduces a circular dependency.

```bash
graq preflight "add payment processing to checkout service"
# → 6 modules will be affected
# → LESSON: payment module must never call user service directly
# → Similar function exists in billing.py — consider reusing
```

You build with architectural awareness that accumulates as you build. By the time you ship, the graph is a complete living specification.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Maintaining a legacy codebase</b></summary>

Legacy systems are where Graqle is most valuable. No single developer has the full picture. Assumptions are buried across dozens of files. A change to one module silently breaks five others.

The graph maps hidden dependencies explicitly. A new engineer gets full architectural context for any module in seconds. A senior engineer validates that a refactor is safe before touching a single line.

```bash
graq context legacy_payments.py     # 500-token focused context
graq impact legacy_payments.py      # what depends on this
graq lessons payment                # what went wrong here before
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>CI/CD governance gate</b></summary>

Every PR runs `graq preflight`. The gate produces a confidence score. Below threshold: blocked.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/graqle-gate.yml
- name: Graqle governance gate
  run: |
    graq predict "$(git diff HEAD~1 --stat | head -20)" \
      --confidence-threshold 0.80 \
      --fail-below-threshold
```

Architecture-aware quality control that scales across teams without requiring every reviewer to understand every subsystem.

## Real results

<details>
<summary><b>Dental appointment system — 8 bugs in 90 seconds (live demo, 2026-03-28)</b></summary>

A 6-file, 410-line Flask dental appointment system. Bugs planted as a realistic "vibe coded" application would produce them.

**What every standard tool missed:**
- BUG-001 CRITICAL: `cancel()` in `app.py` — no auth. Traces through `app.py → services.py`. Neither file checks auth. Only visible as a relationship.
- BUG-002 CRITICAL: `search()` — unauthenticated. Empty query returns all patients. HIPAA violation.
- BUG-005 HIGH: Double-booking not prevented. `services.py` assumes `models.py` checks overlap. `models.py` assumes `services.py` does. Neither does. Only visible as a cross-file assumption gap.
- BUG-006 MEDIUM: `notifications.py` bypasses service layer entirely. Schema change in `models.py` silently breaks it.

**Graqle found all 8. 89–90% confidence. AWS Bedrock. 3 minutes.**

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>17,418 nodes, 8 audits, $0.30</b></summary>

Three repos merged into one knowledge graph. 8 parallel SCORCH audits across the entire surface. Found a CTA button that was 20px tall (44px minimum for mobile touch targets). Fixed before a single prospect saw it.

**Scale:** 17,418 nodes | 70,545 edges | 8 audits | Total cost: $0.30

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Graqle scores itself — from 6.4 to 8.5 across 5 releases</b></summary>

Graqle uses Graqle to manage its own development. From v0.12.3 (6.4/10) to v0.29.9 (8.5/10) — every improvement guided by the knowledge graph's own intelligence layer. 1,569+ tests. 5,579 compiled nodes. Graph-powered development, by the graph.

This is not a demo feature. This is proof the tool works at the scale and complexity of real software.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>How is this different from Copilot / Cursor?</b></summary>

Copilot and Cursor are file-level tools. They see what is written in one file. Graqle sees the relationships between files — the dependency graph, the assumption chains, the blast radius of every change. They generate code. Graqle makes generated code safe to ship. They are not competitors. Graqle is the layer beneath them.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How is this different from LangChain or CrewAI?</b></summary>

LangChain and CrewAI are orchestration frameworks — they chain agents and prompts. They are stateless: no persistent graph, no accumulated institutional memory, no topology-governed agent activation. Graqle is the persistent typed knowledge substrate that agentic frameworks are missing. If you are building agents that write code, Graqle is the memory and governance layer your agents need underneath.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does my code leave my machine?</b></summary>

Never. All graph processing is local. Cloud sync uploads graph structure only — never source code. Use `GRAQLE_OFFLINE=1` for fully air-gapped operation.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use my own LLM / AWS account?</b></summary>

Yes. 14 backends. One line in `graqle.yaml` switches providers. AWS Bedrock uses your existing IAM profile — no new credentials needed. Ollama runs fully offline on your own GPU at zero cost.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How long does scanning take?</b></summary>

Under 30 seconds for most codebases. 10K+ file monorepos take 1–2 minutes. The graph persists — subsequent scans are incremental.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why not just use static analysis?</b></summary>

Static analysis tells you what code exists. Graqle tells you how it connects, what breaks when it changes, what your team has learned about it, and what the blast radius of the next change will be. Static analysis is a search tool. Graqle is a reasoning architecture.
